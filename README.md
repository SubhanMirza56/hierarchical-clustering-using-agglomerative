# hierarchical-clustering-using-agglomerative
Hierarchical clustering is an unsupervised learning method that builds a tree-like structure of nested clusters. It can be agglomerative (bottom-up) or divisive (top-down), using distance measures and linkage methods. The dendrogram helps visualize and choose the optimal number of clusters.
